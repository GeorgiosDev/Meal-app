# Meal-app
A simple HTML-CSS-JS project to get a recipe and a video tutorial from the ingredients you have.

Kudos to GeekProbin for this video tutorial.

I was able through coding along to get a better understanding of fetching an API and manipulating the data. 
As time goes by i am getting more and more comfortable with fetching API's and presenting data on browser


CSS part was also very important as i was able to understand media queries a lot better.
